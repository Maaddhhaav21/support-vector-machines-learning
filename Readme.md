# Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Fundamentals

This repository contains my hands-on learning implementations of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using Python and scikit-learn.
The focus of this repository is to build a strong conceptual and practical understanding of SVM algorithms.

## What This Repository Covers

### Support Vector Classification (SVC)
- Binary classification using Support Vector Machines
- Margin maximization and support vectors
- Effect of hyperparameter C
- Linear decision boundaries

### SVM Kernels
- Linear Kernel
- Polynomial Kernel
- RBF (Gaussian) Kernel
- Non-linear decision boundaries
- Understanding the kernel trick

### Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Regression using Support Vector Machines
- Role of epsilon, C, and kernel
- Difference between SVR and traditional regression methods

## Objective

This repository was created to:
- Understand how maximum margin classifiers work
- Learn the intuition behind kernel-based learning
- Practice hyperparameter tuning in SVM
- Strengthen machine learning fundamentals

Note: This is a learning-focused repository, not a production or deployment project.
