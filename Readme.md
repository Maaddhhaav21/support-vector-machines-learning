# Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Fundamentals & Implementation

This repository contains my **hands-on learning implementations of Support Vector Machines (SVM)** using Python and scikit-learn.

The goal of this repository is to build a **strong conceptual and practical understanding** of SVMs, including classification, regression, and kernel-based decision boundaries.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository was created to:

- Understand the **mathematical intuition** behind SVMs
- Learn how **maximum margin classifiers** work
- Explore **kernel-based non-linear classification**
- Practice **hyperparameter tuning** in SVMs
- Build strong ML fundamentals before moving to advanced projects

⚠️ This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a production or deployment project.
